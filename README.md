Upset
=====

This is a fork of upset, an UPS patcher which has been lost in the depths
of the internet.

All unnecessary files have been removed. A command line interface has been added.

The original code is under the nall directory. It was placed in the public
domain by its author "byuu". The code in the upset_cli.cpp is distributed under
the GPL 3.0 license.
