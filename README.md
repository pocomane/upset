Upset
=====

This is a fork of upset, an UPS patcher which has been lost in the depths
of the internet.

All unnecessary files have been removed. A command line interface has been added.

The original code is under the `nall` directory. It was placed in the public
domain by its author "byuu", as was reported in the following note at top of
the original Makefile:

```
# Makefile
# author: byuu
# license: public domain
```

The code in `upset.cpp` is my new command line interface and it is placed in
the Public Domain too.
